# W2D2-Feb12 - Web Servers 101
This repo contains a couple of exercises. 

## Simple HTTP Server 
In the first one (http-server.js), we explored the simple http server module. We practiced simple resource request/response processing. It is a simple and light web server, of the "hello world" type, with limited functionality.

## Express Web Server
In the second exercise, we explored Express (express-server.js), a full fledged web server module that provides a variety of expansion possibilities through utility modules and middleware. It is a minimal, thin layer, flexible web application server, that allows separation of concerns (application of the MVC pattern), by separating presentation (EJS templates) and application logic. Express is the core of several tech stacks and frameworks including MEAN, Feathers and Kites.

We created a small application that allows exploring a list of users that we downloaded from [here](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users).
